 * @brief Defines the Transform struct for representing 2D transformations in the game engine.
 * Transform is a fundamental structure that encapsulates translation, rotation, and scaling in 2D
 * space. It is widely used for positioning, rotating, and scaling game objects within the game
 * world.
